THE XFPT PLAIN TEXT TO XML PROCESSOR
------------------------------------

I wrote xfpt because I found AsciiDoc to be too slow for large documents, and
also to have too many quirks and gotchas.


UNIX AND UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS
--------------------------

It should just be a matter of typing

  ./configure
  make
  make install

to get youself an installed xfpt command. There is a man page that lists the
command arguments. The main documentation is provided as a PDF file and an HTML
file in the doc directory. The xfpt source that was used to create the XML that
in turn was used to generate the PDF and the HTML is also included. You can get
rid of xfpt by "make uninstall".


OTHER SYSTEMS
-------------

xfpt consists almost entirely of Standard C code, and so it should be possible
to compile it on any system with a Standard C compiler and library.
