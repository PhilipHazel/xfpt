ChangeLog file for xfpt
-----------------------

Release 1.00 08-March-2023
--------------------------

1. Fix crash when --version used (double file close, a consequence of 4 below).

2. Some general code tidies have been done and the tests have been extended in
   the light of coverage checking and to test various command line options. The
   documentation has also been given an overhaul. It seems like time to move to
   a 1.00 release.


Release 0.11 04-September-2020
------------------------------

1. Fix a buffer overrun (read) for a missing delimiter after $=2 (for example).

2. Give an error if a binary zero is encountered in the input, and ignore it.

3. Give an error if input source nesting is too deep (e.g. a runaway recursive
macro).

4. Yet more tidying to ensure all memory gets freed (2 below was very
incomplete).


Release 0.10 28-August-2018
---------------------------

1. A few minor code re-writings to avoid compiler warnings when compiled with
   lots of warnings turned on.

2. Slightly more involved re-writings to ensure that all memory gets freed.

3. Fixed typos in the documentation.

4. Recognize --version as well as -v.


Release 0.09 18-May-2012
------------------------

1. Add the "check" feature to .push to give a warning for certain items on the
   stack that are automatically popped at the end of processing.

2. Update the standard macros so that "check" warnings are given for unclosed
   lists, displays, footnotes, etc.


Release 0.08 22-July-2009
-------------------------

1. The macro ".image" was generating </imagedata> on a new line, thus causing
   some XML processors to think there was content (the newline) when there is
   not supposed to be.

2. A "read random memory" bug that was probably introduced with change 0.06/1
   caused a crash on 64-bit Mac OS X, though not in other environments. The
   random memory was allocated, so never showed with valgrind. The crash
   happened right at the end of the input.


Release 0.07
------------

Added macros .endpreface, etc, and .pi. There is no change of code, except to
bump the version number.


Release 0.06
------------

1. The .include directive was not working correctly when it appeared inside
   a macro. The contents of the file were not read until after the macro's
   lines had been processed. Mixing of .include and macro calls, in any
   combination, should now work correctly. A full traceback of the position of
   any errors is now given (formerly it stopped when a position in a file was
   given).


Release 0.05
------------

1. The .nonl directive was not being handled correctly when it appeared at the
   start of a paragraph and in some other cases. Its argument is now handled as
   the next input line, but without a newline on the end.


Release 0.04
------------

1. Single quotes were being turned into typographic quotes inside <literal>
   phrases, when they should not be. Normal cases (where <literal> is generated
   by an xfpt macro) are now handled correctly.

2. The .vlist macro didn't set .literal off at the end, causing a following
   .new macro not to work properly; it generated bad XML.


Release 0.03
------------

1. Added .nest built-in directive in order to support .footnote and .endnote
   macros (also added).

2. Other new macros: .figure, .image, .preface, .appendix, .colophon, .table.


Release 0.02
------------

1. Added the .inliteral directive.

2. Added the .nonl directive.

3. Updated the .new and .wen directives to work properly in literal sections.


Release 0.01
------------

Added new macros .index-from, .index-to, .index-see, and .index-seealso.


Release 0.00
------------

This is the first release. There are no changes yet!
